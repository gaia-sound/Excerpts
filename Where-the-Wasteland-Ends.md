### Chapter 4: The Sin of Idolatry

#### *Idolatry and Damnation*
It is only after Protestant iconoclasm has at last rooted sacramental perception out of our culture that we arrive, for the first time in history, at a condition of true idolatry. All knowledge becomes a single-visioned knowledge of mere objects, an objective knowledge from which, we feel certain, mastery, security, affluence flow. Again the psychic metaphors tell the story. Nature as excrement means money means power. These are tempting prizes, sufficient to induce non-Protestants to join the iconoclast cause. Ours is indeed "the Protestant era"--in the sense that societies everywhere, of all religious and irreligious persuasions, have appropriated just enough of the Protestant project to give them a desacralized cosmos susceptible to scientific analysis and technological exploitation.

And the idolatrous momentum carries further. In the midst of a nature as deprived of magicality--perhaps even of immediate visibility--as that which industrial urbanites know, more and more it is only the works of man that command admiration. The technological repertory of the artificial environment takes the place of the miraculous, like so many brilliantly fascinating figures against a drably alien ground. Machines, gadgets, devices, techniques monopolize attention and high esteem. They take our breath away as nothing else does and command our abject dependence. Consider the computers, the data banks, the great cybernated systems, the remembering machines and predicting machines, the controlling machines and deciding machines on which ever more of our daily survival depends... is it not with us as the prophet said of the heathen? 'For life he beseecheth that which is dead, And for aid he supplicateth that which hath least experience.' How is it again that Augustine described idolatry? 'Mankind tyrannized over by the work of his own hands.'

'Worship,' it may seem, is too strong a word for this relationship between man and his artificial environment. After all, worship is always conditioned by its object. The technological paraphernalia of our society, for all its prowess, may not carry religious contemplation far, not beyond a sort of low-grade amazement and routine applause. But... as far as it carries the mind is as far as we go. This is as great an exercise of worship as the prevailing Reality Principle permits. And we settle for it... most of us.

I think perhaps this is what damnation means: to live out one's days imprisoned in this idolatrous realm, the infinite universe which Pascal could only describe as 'a little prison cell.' But we have made a great discovery. Namely, that hell can be an interesting place! The world may indeed be God's dunghill; but there is much to be discovered and reclaimed therein. It can be worked. It can be made neat and productive. The life's energy of generations can be expended developing the thing, covering it over with concrete and plastic and sprawling supercities, finding faster ways to travel over and across its surfaces, consuming its substance and inventing substitutes for its depleted elements. In this busy way the time may be passed, and we shall get used to the idolatrous life. We shall make ourselves at home in it. Milton's fallen angels toyed with just such a strategy for enduring the unendurable. Significantly, it was Mammon, the demon of affluence, who devised this as a program for progress among the dammed.

### Chapter 5: A Dead Man's Eyes

#### *The Scientific Revolution: Idolatry and Triumphant*
It is a familiar human vice. We project the sins that reside in our hearts, locating them far off, in others, in adversaries whom we then assail and persecute for our own guilt. For centuries, the tendency toward idolatry in Judeo-Christian culture was externalized as scorn for pagan worship and the reproof of heresy. Still today, the discussion of idolatry would be thought of as an old religious subject matter, a dead controversy no longer part of our lives. At the superficial level of intellectual history, this is true enough. But within the evolution of consciousness, it is a different story. Idolatry has come into its own not within the mainstream religious life of the west, but as the psychic style belonging to a wholly new and domineering cultural enterprise--a 'New Philosophy' as Francis Bacon called seventeenth-century science.

Here is the subterranean link between the religion and science of the western world. The two are far from being antagonists--as one might suspect when one notices, especially in the Protestant societies, how smoothly science took its place in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries alongside the prevailing religion, and indeed what very devout men the early scientists were. There was a 'scientific revolution' during the age of Galileo, Kepler, Newton; but it was a revolution for which Christianity had long since been making ready the psychic ground. The melodramatic confrontation between Galileo and the Church (usually misread), often obscures the truth of the matter. What was most revolutionary about the revolution was not the struggle with Christian religious psychology, but with its overlay of inherited Aristotelian concepts. And what was the great obstacle that the pagan Aristotle posed? Simply that his study of nature preserved, if only as a weak residue, too much of the Old Gnosis, too much of the sense of nature alive and infused with purpose, nature aglow with seductively sensuous qualities. This was nature as it had been known in pagan worship--philosophically intellectualized by Aristotle, yet nonetheless a nature that concealed divinity never far below the surface of appearances. These remnants of a degraded pagan naturalism were the ancien r√©gime that had to be overthrown by single vision before Christian society could produce its own peculiar natural philosophy. What science did was to extract from western man's religious psychology its well-developed idolatrous disposition and to elaborate the experience of nature that lay within it--at first with every expectation that this fresh worldview would serve piety, not detract from it.

#### *The Secret of Power-Knowledge*
Objective knowing gives us a new assembly line system of knowledge, one which relieves us of the necessity to integrate what we study into a moral or metaphysical context which will contribute to existential value. We no longer waste valuable research time and energy seeking for wisdom or depth, since these are qualities of the person. We are free to become specialists, and then, as impersonal researchers, we need only worry about being well informed (in our field), well bibliographied (in our field), and correct (in our field). By way of such microscopic professionalism, knowledge is indeed heaped enormously on all sides, until at last we begin to worry that there will not be libraries or data-retrieval systems capacious enough to contain the abundance.

We may shake our heads wondering how our ancestors managed to survive for a day knowing so much less than we do. But there is a more pertinent question. How are *we* to create a sane life in the midst of such an expanding universe of disintegrated research? What our competitive and careerist knowledge industry has produced already hopelessly exceeds our ability to make graceful use of it. The abundance does not cohere. Like the physicist's particle zoo, it increases as the focus tightens; but no enduring patterns emerge. The sum total of such information contributes pitifully little to the quality of life as it is lived day by day; yet it is the duty of no profession to give it existential validity. Beyond the boundaries of his discipline, each expert plays dumb. It does not occur to us that it may be as irresponsible to leave unintegrated knowledge laying about as to produce babies and abandon them on the nearest doorstep.

Finally, we begin to resemble the sad hero of Ionesco's play *The New Tenant*, overwhelmed and immobilized by a mountainous conglomeration of intellectual furniture. So it becomes our desperate project to program this slag heap of data points into the computers. The machines will know it all! The idea that culture is an adventure of the human spirit, to be carried on in fellowship for the good of our souls, vanishes from sight. "Thinking machines" (or at least"memory tapes") which merely counterfeit the formal surface of a real idea (but never feel its depth or rich ambiguity, never sense its personal resonance) become the electronic stitches of a cultural crazy quilt. And the thinking machines, of course, will be owned, programmed, and employed by the technocracy. They will not be *our* servants.
